        Maybe I was wrong and you were right
        But I don't really wanna have this fight
        I just wanna feel like I belong
        And every time my heart swings back to you
        You are my morning and my truth
        And all that I can do is sing this song
        It ain't that long, mm
        
        And nothing says "I love you" like your eyes
        Fill my lips with carbon dioxide
        I just wanna feel like I deserve you
        'Cause you deserve me
        Baby, it's the way that you can see
        What I miss and what I can never be
        I just wanna feel like I deserve you
        'Cause you deserve me
        
        Maybe you were wrong and I was right
        I don't care, won't you stay another night?
        I just need some time to be myself
        I couldn't say "I need you" on that night
        When you left and I lost all track of time
        I just want you close so I can feel you
        Can you feel me? Mmm
        
        And nothing says "I love you" like the words
        That were never said, but could be heard
        If only there was peace around us, baby
        You would hear me
        And maybe it's the way that lovers do
        I just want for me what I want for you
        Only with the sun above us maybe
        You would see me
        
        And even if you leave, I may be fine
        'Cause my heart, it has its own design
        And even if you never see it, baby
        You're all that I need
        
        Maybe it's the silence in your eyes
        Maybe it's the lilac when you're shy
        Maybe it's the mystery of your love
        All I need is a sign from the stars above
        Maybe it's the way that you breathe in me
        Maybe it's the man that you see in me
        Maybe it's the fragrance of your hair
        Yeah, I just wanna kiss you when you're there
        
        I just want you all around me, baby
        Can we make that happen, please?
